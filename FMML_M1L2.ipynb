There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        " * Reduces variance: By using multiple splits, you're essentially running multiple experiments. This helps to reduce the variance that can arise from a single split, leading to more reliable estimates of the model's performance.\n",
        " * Improves generalization: Averaging across different splits helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting to any particular training set and is more likely to generalize well to unseen data.\n",
        " * Identifies overfitting: If the validation accuracy varies significantly across different splits, it can be a sign of overfitting.\n",
        "Common techniques for splitting data:\n",
        " * K-fold cross-validation: The dataset is divided into k folds, and the model is trained and evaluated k times, each time using a different fold for validation.\n",
        " * Stratified k-fold cross-validation: Ensures that each fold contains approximately the same proportion of samples from each class.\n",

        "Gradient Descent Algorithms:\n",
        " * More iterations, better estimate: Typically, increasing the number of iterations leads to a more accurate estimate as the algorithm converges closer to the optimal solution. However, there's a trade-off: too many iterations can lead to overfitting.\n",
        " * Learning rate: The learning rate also plays a crucial role. A smaller learning rate might require more iterations for convergence, but it can help avoid overfitting.\n",

        " * Fewer iterations, often sufficient: SGD is generally more efficient than batch gradient descent, requiring fewer iterations to converge.\n",

        "Other Algorithms:\n",

        " * Watch out for overfitting: While more iterations can improve accuracy, it can also lead to overfitting, especially with complex models.\n",
